            I like minecraft it is my favorite game. Here are a few reasons why. Minecraft is a video game in which players create and break apart various kinds of blocks in three-dimensional worlds. The game's two main modes are Survival and Creative. In Survival, players must find their own building supplies and food. They also interact with blocklike mobs, or moving creatures. Since its release in 2009, Minecraft has quickly become one of the most popular games in the world. ... Minecraft has been described as a game with no rules. It doesn't come with a set of instructions, or a stated objective â€“ players can build and explore however they want. It's often compared to virtual Lego. Minecraft was made by Notch. </p>
